Inoui - Paysages inouïs d'Orléans
=================================
Personal artistic project by Alexandre Quessy.

Browse a map with a fiducial marker to hear the sounds from a city.


How to make it work
-------------------
 * On Ubuntu Precise, run the script in utils/install_deps.sh
 * Install reactivision, from http://sourceforge.net/projects/reactivision/files/
 * install lunch from https://launchpad.net/~sat-metalab/+archive/metalab
 * install the ambi abstractions for Pure Data Vanilla from https://github.com/aalex/ambi
 * make sure to add them to your -path in pd. (see ~/.pdrc)
 * run ./one_click_build.sh

Next, you should plug in a camera that works with reactivision. You need four speakers. You might want to run Pure Data with JACK, depending on your audio device and your preferences.

Finally:

cd ~/path/to/inoui/
lunch -g launch_inoui.lunch
